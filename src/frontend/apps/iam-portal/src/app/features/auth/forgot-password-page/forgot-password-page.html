<section class="page">
  <h1>Forgot Password</h1>
  <p>
    Employees will enter their email address here. The frontend will call
    <code>POST /api/iam/auth/forgot-password</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The backend always returns a generic “If this email exists, we sent a link”
    message to avoid leaking whether the account is valid.
